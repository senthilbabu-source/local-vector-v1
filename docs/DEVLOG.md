## 2026-02-24 — Docs Sync: Eliminate Stale/Missing Documentation (Completed)

**Goal:** Audit all docs for conflicts, stale counts, and missing information after Sprint 42 + E2E fixes.

**Scope:**
- `docs/DEVLOG.md` — **CREATED.** Never existed in git despite being referenced by CLAUDE.md and AI_RULES §13. Built from full git history (Phases 1-9 through Sprint 42), includes current test counts and E2E spec inventory table.
- `docs/AI_RULES.md` — Added Rule §29: Playwright E2E Spec Patterns (locator hygiene, API-result-agnostic assertions, auth session files, test count verification). All 28 existing rules verified as current — no conflicts.
- `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` — Added Tailwind v4 design tokens section (midnight-slate, surface-dark, electric-indigo, signal-green, alert-crimson, truth-emerald, alert-amber) with usage contexts. Legacy `T.` object preserved for marketing pages.
- `docs/CHECKPOINT_1.md` — Updated test counts (336→473 Vitest, added 36 E2E), feature list expanded to include Surgeries 1-6 and Sprints 35-42. "Not built" list trimmed from 8 to 2 items.
- `app/pricing/page.tsx` — Fixed wrong comment: "electric-indigo" → "signal-green" (matches actual `border-signal-green` implementation).
- `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM-COMPONENTS.md` — Verified current, no changes needed.
- `docs/14_TESTING_STRATEGY.md` — Removed deleted `viral-wedge.spec.ts` from E2E spec table. Updated table to 12 spec files / 36 tests. Fixed stale "racy isPending" note referencing the deleted file.

## 2026-02-24 — E2E Fix: Repair 7 Pre-existing Failures (Completed)

**Goal:** Fix all 7 pre-existing E2E test failures that predated Sprint 42.

**Scope:**
- `tests/e2e/01-viral-wedge.spec.ts` — Rewrote for Sprint 33 redirect-to-/scan flow. Added `.first()` for duplicated scanner form (hero + CTA). Button text → "Run Free AI Audit". API-result-agnostic heading assertion (real Perplexity returns pass or fail).
- `tests/e2e/viral-wedge.spec.ts` — **DELETED**. Outdated pre-Sprint-29 spec superseded by `01-viral-wedge.spec.ts`.
- `tests/e2e/03-dashboard-fear-first.spec.ts` — Reality Score now shows `—` (em-dash) when no visibility scan data exists. Changed assertion from `87` to `—`.
- `tests/e2e/billing.spec.ts` — Growth card highlight changed from `border-electric-indigo` to `border-signal-green`. Tier name locators use `getByRole('heading')` to avoid footer text matches.

**Verification:** 36/36 Playwright E2E tests passing. 473 Vitest tests passing.
