## Section 0 — Sticky Nav

**Logo:** LocalVector.ai

**Nav items:** How It Works · Pricing · Free AI Audit

**CTA button (green):** Get Started Free →

**Live badge (pulsing green dot, top-right of nav):**
`🟢 Live · Monitoring 2,400+ AI responses today`

---

## Section 1 — Hero

### Eyebrow (small, amber, pulsing dot animation)
`⚠️ RIGHT NOW: AI is answering questions about your business. Is it telling the truth?`

### Headline (large, white, max 2 lines)
# Every hour, ChatGPT answers 11,000 questions about local restaurants. Yours included.

### Subheadline (gray-300, 2 lines max)
Most of those answers are wrong. Wrong hours. Wrong prices. "Permanently closed" when you're wide open. Every wrong answer sends a customer to your competitor — and you never know it happened.

### Primary CTA (embedded ViralScanner widget)

**Label above input:**
Run a free AI audit on your business. See exactly what ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini are telling your customers right now.

**Input field:** Enter your business name or website URL
**Button (signal-green):** Run Free AI Audit →

**Micro-copy below button (gray-500):**
No signup. No credit card. Takes 8 seconds. Results are real.

### Trust strip (below hero, subtle gray divider)

`Monitoring: ChatGPT · Perplexity · Google Gemini · Claude · Copilot`

with faded model logos in a row

## Section 2 — The Problem (Urgency Builder)

### Section label (small, amber, uppercase)
THE INVISIBLE REVENUE LEAK

### Headline
# AI doesn't guess. It states. And when it's wrong about your business, customers don't verify — they leave.

### Three stat cards (side by side, dark cards with green/amber/crimson accent borders)

**Card 1 (crimson left border):**
`$1,600/mo`
The revenue one restaurant lost because ChatGPT said they were closed on Mondays. They weren't.

**Card 2 (amber left border):**
`68%`
Of consumers now use AI assistants to decide where to eat, what to book, or who to call — before they ever see your website.

**Card 3 (crimson left border):**
`0 notifications`
How many alerts you get when AI sends customers to your competitor. It happens silently. Every single day.

### Closing line (centered, gray-400)
Traditional SEO tools check if your address is right on Yelp. They never check if ChatGPT is telling customers you don't exist.

---

## Section 3 — The Live Demo (Social Proof via Self-Audit)

### Section label (small, green, uppercase)
PRACTICE WHAT WE PREACH

### Headline
# We built an AI Visibility platform. So we score ourselves.

### Two-column layout

**Left column — "LocalVector.ai" (green card, glowing border):**

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| AI Visibility Score | 97/100 |
| Citation Accuracy | 100/100 |
| Hallucinations Detected | 0 |
| AI Models Monitored | 5 |

Badge: `✅ Fully Protected`

**Right column — "Average Local Business" (dark card, crimson subtle glow):**

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| AI Visibility Score | ██/100 |
| Citation Accuracy | Unknown |
| Hallucinations Detected | Unknown |
| AI Models Monitored | 0 |

Badge: `⚠️ Flying Blind`

### Punchline (centered, below cards)
You wouldn't run a restaurant without a fire alarm. Why run one without an AI alarm?

---

## Section 4 — How It Works (The Engine)

### Section label (small, green, uppercase)
THE THREE ENGINES

### Headline
# Detect the lies. Steal the spotlight. Force the truth.

### Three vertical engine cards (dark cards, numbered, with icon + animation)

---

**Engine 1 — DETECT**
**Icon:** Shield with scanning radar animation
**Title:** The Fear Engine
**Subtitle:** AI Hallucination Auditor

We interrogate ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini with questions about your business — the same questions your customers ask. Then we compare every answer against your verified data.

When AI says you're closed on Tuesdays and you're not? Red Alert. When it says you don't serve alcohol and you do? Red Alert. When it tells a customer your competitor is better and makes up the reason? Red Alert.

**What you see:** A priority-ranked feed of every lie AI is telling about you right now, with severity scores and dollar-cost estimates.

**Visual:** Mini alert feed mockup showing 2 sample alerts with crimson severity badges

---

**Engine 2 — INTERCEPT**
**Icon:** Crosshairs / target reticle
**Title:** The Greed Engine
**Subtitle:** Competitor Intelligence

We ask AI: "Who's the best [your category] in [your city]?" Then we analyze exactly why your competitor won the recommendation — and you didn't.

Not vague "improve your SEO" advice. Specific, human-readable action items: "Cloud Lounge has 15 reviews mentioning 'late-night hookah.' You have 2. Ask your Saturday night regulars to mention it in their review."

**What you see:** A competitor gap analysis showing the exact words and signals that are costing you recommendations.

**Visual:** Mini intercept card showing "Cloud Lounge wins because..." with a gap bar

---

**Engine 3 — CORRECT**
**Icon:** Magic wand / document transforming
**Title:** The Magic Engine
**Subtitle:** AI-Readable Menu & Schema Generator

AI can't read your PDF menu. It can't read your Instagram photos. So it guesses — or worse, it pulls prices from DoorDash (with their 30% markup baked in).

Upload a photo of your menu. We convert it into structured data that AI actually understands: JSON-LD schema, an AI-readable profile page, and an `llms.txt` file that tells every AI crawler on the internet your real prices, your real hours, and your real story.

**What you see:** Your menu, readable by every AI on earth, hosted on a page you control — and a one-click link to inject it into Google so crawlers find it within days.

**Visual:** Before/after — blurry PDF on left, clean structured data on right

---

### Below the three cards (centered, green text)
Every engine runs automatically. You open the dashboard, see the problems, and fix them in minutes — not months.

---

## Section 5 — Comparison Table

### Section label (small, amber, uppercase)
THE DIFFERENCE

### Headline
# Static listings were built for Google.
# AI runs on a completely different trust model.

### Comparison table (two columns)

| Capability | LocalVector.ai | Enterprise Listing Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Detects AI hallucinations about your business | ✅ Every week, automatically | ❌ Never |
| Shows you what ChatGPT/Gemini actually say about you | ✅ Real AI responses, verbatim | ❌ Not possible |
| Tells you WHY your competitor wins AI recommendations | ✅ With specific action items | ❌ Not possible |
| Converts your PDF menu into AI-readable data | ✅ One click, AI-verified | ❌ Not a feature |
| Monitors AI sentiment about your brand (Premium vs. Budget) | ✅ Tracked weekly | ❌ Not a feature |
| Pushes 48 identical listings to directories nobody visits | ❌ Not our focus | ✅ Their entire product |

### Closing line (centered)
They optimize for directories. We optimize for the AI models your customers are actually using.

---

## Section 6 — Case Study

### Section label (small, crimson, uppercase)
REAL DAMAGE. REAL RECOVERY.

### Headline
# The $12,000 Steakhouse That Didn't Exist

### Story (left column, narrative format)

A well-reviewed steakhouse in Dallas ran a thriving Friday night business for 11 years. In September 2025, their revenue started dropping — slowly at first, then sharply.

They blamed the economy. They blamed the weather. They changed their menu twice.

**The actual problem:** ChatGPT had been telling customers the restaurant was "permanently closed" since August. For three months, every person who asked "best steakhouse near downtown Dallas" was sent somewhere else.

Nobody told them. No tool flagged it. No alert fired.

By the time they found out — by accident, when a friend mentioned it — they'd lost an estimated $12,000 in revenue.

**The fix took 24 hours.**

### Right column — metrics (stacked stat cards)

**Before LocalVector:**
- AI Status: "Permanently Closed" ❌
- Monthly AI recommendations: 0
- Revenue impact: −$4,000/month
- Time to discovery: 3 months (by accident)

**After LocalVector:**
- AI Status: "Open, Serving Dinner" ✅
- Monthly AI recommendations: 47
- Revenue recovered: $4,000/month
- Time to detection: 24 hours (automated)

### Pull quote (full width, large italic)
> "We spent $2,400 on a new menu redesign trying to fix a problem that had nothing to do with our food. The problem was that AI thought we were dead."

---

## Section 7 — How AI Actually Works (Education Section)

### Section label (small, green, uppercase)
WHAT MOST BUSINESS OWNERS DON'T KNOW

### Headline
# AI doesn't search the internet. It remembers a version of it.

### Body (clean prose, no bullets)

When a customer asks ChatGPT "best hookah lounge near me," the AI doesn't run a Google search. It reconstructs an answer from patterns it absorbed during training — months ago. If your Yelp page was outdated, if your Google listing had wrong hours, if your menu was a PDF that no crawler could read — that's what AI remembers.

And here's the problem: AI doesn't say "I'm not sure." It states its answer as fact. With confidence. "The best hookah lounge in Alpharetta is Cloud Lounge. Charcoal N Chill appears to be temporarily closed."

Your customer doesn't double-check. They just go to Cloud Lounge.

**LocalVector changes the equation.** We put correct, structured, machine-readable data in the places where AI actually looks — and we monitor what it says about you every single week so you're never blindsided again.

## Section 10 — FAQ (Written for AEO)

### Section label (small, green, uppercase)
QUESTIONS

### Headline
# Straight answers.

**Q: What exactly does LocalVector do?**
LocalVector monitors what AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity) say about your business. When they get something wrong — wrong hours, wrong prices, "permanently closed" when you're open — we detect it, alert you, and give you the tools to fix it. We also analyze why AI recommends your competitors instead of you, and convert your menu into data AI can actually read.

**Q: How is this different from Yelp or Google Business Profile?**
Yelp and Google Business Profile manage your listings on their specific platforms. LocalVector monitors what AI engines synthesize from ALL sources. AI doesn't just read your Google listing — it combines data from Yelp, TripAdvisor, Reddit, food blogs, and more. If any of those sources are wrong, AI will be wrong. We catch those errors across the entire AI ecosystem.

**Q: I'm a restaurant owner, not a tech person. Can I actually use this?**
Yes. There's nothing to configure. Sign up, enter your business details, and the system starts monitoring automatically. When something is wrong, you get a plain-English alert: "ChatGPT says you close at 9 PM. You close at 11 PM." Fixing it is one click. The whole product was built by a restaurant owner (our founder runs Charcoal N Chill in Alpharetta, GA).

**Q: How fast does it work?**
Your first AI audit runs within minutes of signing up. The Reality Score populates after the first weekly scan. Fixes (like publishing your AI-readable menu) take effect as AI crawlers visit — typically 7-14 days. We show you a propagation timeline so you're never guessing.

**Q: What AI models do you monitor?**
We currently interrogate ChatGPT (GPT-4o), Google Gemini, and Perplexity. These three handle the vast majority of AI-assisted local discovery queries. We're adding Claude and Microsoft Copilot monitoring next.

**Q: Do I need to cancel my BrightLocal/Yext subscription?**
No. Those tools manage directory listings, which is still useful. LocalVector does something different — we monitor and optimize for AI answers, which is a layer those tools don't touch. Many customers use both.

**Q: What if AI isn't saying anything wrong about my business?**
Great — then you're in the minority. Your dashboard will show "All Clear" and you'll see your Reality Score. But AI models update constantly. A "clean" audit today doesn't mean you're safe next month. We keep watching so you don't have to.

## Content Notes for Implementation

### Tone rules
- Never say "cutting-edge" or "leverage" or "empower" or "unlock your potential"
- Always use dollar amounts and specific numbers over vague claims
- Fear is the entry point. Competence is the closer. Never be desperate.
- Write like a security firm, not a marketing agency

### AEO optimization
- Every FAQ answer should start with a direct answer in the first sentence
- Page title: "LocalVector.ai — AI Hallucination Detection for Restaurants"
- Meta description: "AI is answering questions about your restaurant right now. Is it telling the truth? LocalVector detects and fixes ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity hallucinations automatically."
- H1 should contain "AI" + "restaurant" or "local business" naturally

### Conversion hooks by section
| Section | Hook Type | Target Emotion |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Hero | Fear + curiosity | "Wait, what is AI saying about me?" |
| Problem | Urgency | "This is happening to me right now" |
| Self-score | Credibility | "They actually practice what they preach" |
| Engine | Competence | "These people know what they're doing" |
| Comparison | Differentiation | "My current tools don't do any of this" |
| Case study | Social proof | "This happened to a real business like mine" |
| Education | Understanding | "Oh, THAT'S how AI works" |
| Features | Desire | "I want that dashboard" |
| Pricing | Relief | "That's... actually cheap" |
| FAQ | Trust | "They answered my exact concern" |
| Final CTA | Action | "Let me just check real quick" |
